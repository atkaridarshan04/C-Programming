Dynamic Memory Allocation 
Its is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during a runtime ,which is provided by heap.

Following are the functions in c to perform Dynamic 

1> malloc :-
It stands for memory allocation , it takes number of bytes to be allocates as an input and returns returns a void pointer, therefore we use typecasting. It will return null pointer if memory is not allocated.
Syntax :-
ptr = (int *)malloc( x * sizeof(int));  // x is an integer 

2> calloc :-
It stands for continous allocation, it initialize each memory block with a default value of 0.If the space is not assigned then the momory allocation is failed and null pointer is returned.
Syntax :-
ptr = (float *)calloc(x, sizeof(float));   // x is an integer 

3> free :-
Use to deallocate the memory.
In calloc and malloc the memory is not deallocated automatically.
Syntax :-
free(ptr);

4> realloc :-
Sometimes the dynamically allocated memory is more or insufficient than required.
realloc is used to allocate memory of new size using previous pointer and size.
Syntax :-
ptr = realloc(ptr, newsize)
i.e ptr = realloc(ptr, x * sizeof(int));    // x is an integer
