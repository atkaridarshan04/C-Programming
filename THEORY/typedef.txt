'typedef' provides a short and meaningful way to call a data type.

Consider the following statement in which the type 'unsigned long int' is redefined to be of 
the type 'TWOWORDS'.
typedef unsigned long int TWOWORDS;  --> application

Now we can declare variables of the type unsigned long int by writing,
TWOWORDS var1, var2 ;

instead of :-
unsigned long int var1, var2;

This can be done on structures, structure pointers , etc.
