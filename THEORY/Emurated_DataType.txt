The enumerated data type gives you an opportunity to invent your own data type and define what values 
the variable of this data type can take. 

Declaration is same as structures :-

enum mar_status
{
single, married, divorced, widowed      // -- > these are values called as emurators
} ;
enum mar_status person1, person2 ;

person1 and person2 are variables, we can assign values to them as 
person1 = married ;
person2 = divorced ;

Internally the compiler treats the emurators as intergers as
by default -> single is stored as 0 , married is stored as 1 and so on.

But we can assign as we want
enum mar_status
{
single = 100, married = 200, divorced = 300, widowed = 400
};
enum mar_status person1, person2
