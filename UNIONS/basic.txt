Union and structures are likely same 

Both structures and unions are used to group a number of different variables together. But while a
structure enables us treat a number of different variables stored at different places in memory, a
union enables us to treat the same space in memory as a number of different variables. That is, a  
union offers a way for a section of memory to be treated as a variable of one type on one occasion, 
and as a different variable of a different type on another occasion.
