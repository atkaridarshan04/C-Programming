These ‘O-flags’ are defined in the file “fcntl.h”. So this file must be included in the program while using low-level file I/O

O_APPEND - Opens a file for appending

O_CREAT - Creates a new file for writing (has no effect if filealready exists)

O_RDONLY - Opens a new file for reading only

O_RDWR - Creates a file for both reading and writin

O_WRONLY - Creates a file for writing only

O_BINARY - Opens a file in binary mode

O_TEXT - Opens a file in text mode

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

S_IWRITE - Writing to the file permitted
S_IREAD - Reading from the file permitted

To use these permissions, both the files “types.h” and “stat.h” must be 
#included in the program alongwith “fcntl.h”.
