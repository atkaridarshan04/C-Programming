Both are use to handle one integer at a time

syntax:  putw(i,fp1);
i : an integer variable
fp1 : pointer to file ipened with mode w

syntax: i = getw(fp2);
i : an integer variable
fp2 : pointer to file opened with mode r

file pointer moves by one integer position, data stored in binary format native to local system
getw() returns end-of-file marker EOF when file end reached
